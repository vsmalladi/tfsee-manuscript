## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The differentiation of embryonic stem cells into various lineages is highly dependent on the chromatin state and gene expression patterns.
To identify the lineage specific enhancers driving the differentiation of pancreatic cells we used a previously described computational framework called Total Functional Score of Enhancer Elements (TFSEE), which integrates multiple genomic assays that probe both transcriptional and epigenetic states.
Using TFSEE, we defined the enhancer landscape and identified TFs maintaining multipotency of endodermal stem cells during differentiation into pancreatic lineages.
Thus, TFSEE can be used to perform multilayer genomic data integration to uncover novel cell type-specific TFs that control lineage-specific enhancers.

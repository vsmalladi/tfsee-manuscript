## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Integration of different genome data sets to systematically identify active enhancers and associated cognate transcription factors (TFs) remains a difficult process. We propose a computational framework called Total Functional Score of Enhancer Elements (TFSEE), which integrates multiple genomic assays that probe both transcriptional and epigenetic states. Using TFSEE, we defined the enhancer landscape and identified TFs maintaining multipotency of endodermal stem cells during differentiation into pancreatic lineages. We also identified key breast cancer subtype-specific TFs bound at active enhancers which regulate gene expression patterns determining growth outcomes. Thus, TFSEE can be used to perform multilayer genomic data integration to uncover novel cell type-specific TFs that control lineage-specific enhancers.

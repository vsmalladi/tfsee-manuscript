## Conclusions

The increasing availability of different genomic data sets provides an opportunity to perform data integration to uncover novel cell type-specific transcription factor (TF) drivers.
To facilitate identification of these drivers we developed TFSEE, which systemically identify active enhancers and associated cognate TFs.
We showed that TFSEE can identify stage specific TFs during differentiation of endodermal stem cells into pancreatic lineages.
Collectively, our results show how TFSEE can be used to predict molecular drivers maintaining cell type-specific function and biology.
